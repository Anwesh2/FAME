NirX is soluble and apparently located in the periplasm, as judged by the predicted signal sequence. NirI and NirX are homologues of NosR and NosX, proteins involved in regulation of the expression of the nos gene cluster encoding nitrous oxide reductase in Pseudomonas stutzeri and Sinorhizobium meliloti. Analysis of a NirI-deficient mutant strain revealed that NirI is involved in transcription activation of the nir gene cluster in response to oxygen limitation and the presence of N-oxides. The NirX-deficient mutant transiently accumulated nitrite in the growth medium, but it had a final growth yield similar to that of the wild type. Transcription of the nirIX gene cluster itself was controlled by NNR, a member of the family of FNR-like transcriptional activators. An NNR binding sequence is located in the middle of the intergenic region between the nirI and nirS genes with its centre located at position -41.5 relative to the transcription start sites of both genes. Attempts to complement the NirI mutation via cloning of the nirIX gene cluster on a broad-host-range vector were unsuccessful, the ability to express nitrite reductase being restored only when the nirIX gene cluster was reintegrated into the chromosome of the NirI-deficient mutant via homologous recombination in such a way that the wild-type nirI gene was present directly upstream of the nir operon.','Department of Molecular Cell Physiology, Faculty of Biology, BioCentrum Amsterdam, Vrije Universiteit, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.','Molecular microbiology','Mol Microbiol','England',''),('10612833','','1059-7794','2000','9215429','Erratum: analysis of DNA elements that modulate myosin VIIa expression in humans.','False','Usher syndromeIb (USH1B), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in myosin VIIa (MYO7A), is characterized by congenital profound hearing loss, vestibular abnormalities and retinitis pigmentosa.

On endosonography, the duodenal IFP appeared as a coarsely heterogeneous isoechoic and hypoechoic mass circumscribed by a distinct margin and arising from the third layer of the duodenal wall. The endosonographic appearance of this lesion was in marked contrast to that previously reported for gastric IFPs, which have tended to appear as hypoechoic homogeneous lesions with indistinct margins. Endosonographic evaluation of suspected IFPs before endoscopic or surgical treatment is useful.

To better define the involvement of these genes in sporadic cancers, we characterized expression levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2 transcripts in cancer cell lines derived from neoplasms of the ovary, prostate, and breast and compared them with those expressed in primary cultures of normal epithelial cells established from these organs. We observed upregulation of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 expression in six of seven ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCA420, OVCA429, OVCA432, ALST, DOV13, and SKOV3) when compared with levels found in normal ovary surface epithelial cells. Furthermore, five cancerous or immortalized prostatic epithelial cell lines (BPH-1, TSU-Pr1, LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145) also expressed higher levels of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mRNA than did primary cultures of normal prostatic epithelial cells. In contrast, only the estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cell line overexpressed these messages, whereas the estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell lines Hs578T, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 showed no change in expression levels when compared with normal breast epithelial cells. In addition, expanding on our recent identification of a novel BRCA2 transcript variant carrying an in-frame exon 12 deletion (BRCA2 delta 12), we report increased expression of this variant in several ovarian, prostate, and mammary cancer cell lines (OVCA420, OVCA433, ALST, DOV13, SKOV3, TSU-Pr1, DU145, and MDA-MB-468). Most notably, high levels of BRCA2 delta 12 mRNA were detected in an estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, and in an androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line, DU-145. Interestingly, the wild-type BRCA2 transcript was barely detectable in DU145, which could be used as a model system for future investigations on BRCA2 delta 12 function. Taken together, our data suggest disruption of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 gene expression in certain epithelial cancer cell lines of the ovary, prostate, and breast. Because wild-type BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene products increase during cell-cycle progression and are believed to exert growth-inhibitory action, enhanced expression of these genes in cancer cells may represent a negative feedback mechanism for curbing proliferation in fast-growing cells.

Assessment of a patient\'s quality of life (QoL) is now conceptually viewed as an important complement to traditional objective evaluation measures. It was therefore considered important to review the basis for the assessment of this endpoint when The Swedish Council of Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU) performed a systematic overview of chemotherapy effects in several tumour types. The group came to the following conclusions: QoL assessments, mostly by patient self-reporting in questionnaires, have come increasingly into use during the past decade. A number of general, cancer-specific and cancer diagnosis-specific instruments have been developed. There is at present little need for development of new cancer instruments, although specific treatment modalities and tumour types may need new additional modules. A predefined hypothesis should determine the instrument to be used. Since the selection of a QoL instrument in a specific study influences both the results and the conclusions, it is essential to carefully select the instrument or instruments that have the greatest likelihood of identifying relevant differences between treatment alternatives. Interpretation of QoL data is more difficult than interpretation of objective endpoints such as survival time, objective response rates or toxicity. Despite these difficulties, QoL analyses have provided new insights into the advantages and disadvantages of various treatments not provided by traditional end-points. Some palliative treatments seemingly increase patients\' QoL despite side-effects or the lack of, or marginal, increases in survival. When using potentially curative chemotherapy, it is not a matter of when the treatment should be started, but rather when it should be concluded. When using less active chemotherapy, the expected small therapeutic gains must be weighed against the QoL costs of using the therapy: does the toxicity and/or the inconvenience of the proposed treatment justify the expected gain? When it is found that the strain on the patient is greater than the effects of the cancer, treatment must be discontinued. It is not possible to determine whether or not the advantages of palliative chemotherapy are worth their costs without knowledge about patients\' personal values regarding the influence on factors of relevance for QoL. The mostly used QoL questionnaires do not consider individual preferences, which therefore need to be addressed in the dialogue with the patient. QoL assessment is clearly in need of further methodological improvement before this endpoint can be regarded as fully established with respect to ability to provide unequivocally useful data in clinical trials. The multitude of questionnaires, missing data, lack of pre-study hypotheses of relevant differences between treatments and data multiplicity giving a risk for chance findings are examples of serious methodological problems. Patient response-shifts over time further complicate the interpretation of the data. Thus, QoL data, also from seemingly well-performed clinical trials, have to be interpreted cautiously. The international development during recent years has aimed at creating increased standardization of QoL measures. This has created greater possibilities to compare results from different trials. Hopefully, this also implies that it will be possible to draw firmer conclusions from QoL measurements in recently completed or ongoing trials than has been the case previously. QoL assessments are resource demanding even when short standardized questionnaires are used. Since cancer patients also generally give priority to anticancer effects over toxicity and convenience, QoL assessments in clinical trials are motivated mainly in study settings comparing treatments without expected major differences of outcome in objective endpoints.','Department of Oncology, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.','Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)','Acta Oncol','England',''),('11442735','','0303-6979','2001','0425123','Utilisation of locally delivered doxycycline in non-surgical treatment of chronic periodontitis.

Binding of [(35)S]BIO7662 to Jurkat cells was dependent on the presence of divalent cations and could be blocked by treatment with an excess of unlabeled inhibitor or with EDTA. K(D) values for the binding of BIO7662 to Mn(2+)-activated alpha(4)beta(1) and to the nonactivated state of the integrin that exists in 1 mm Mg(2+), 1 mm Ca(2+) were <10 pm, indicating that it has a high affinity for both activated and nonactivated integrin. No binding was observed on alpha(4)beta(1) negative cells. Through an analysis of the metal ion dependences of ligand binding, several unexpected findings about alpha(4)beta(1) function were made. First, we observed that Ca(2+) binding to alpha(4)beta(1) was stimulated by the addition of BIO7662. From solution binding studies on purified alpha(4)beta(1), two types of Ca(2+)-binding sites were identified, one dependent upon and the other independent of BIO7662 binding. Second, we observed that the metal ion dependence of ligand binding was affected by the affinity of the ligand for alpha(4)beta(1). ED(50) values for the metal ion dependence of the binding of BIO7762 and the binding of a lower affinity ligand, BIO1211, differed by 2-fold for Mn(2+), 30-fold for Mg(2+), and >1000-fold for Ca(2+). Low Ca(2+) (ED(50) = 5-10 microm) stimulated the binding of BIO7662 to alpha(4)beta(1). The effects of microm Ca(2+) closely resembled the effects of Mn(2+) on alpha(4)beta(1) function. Third, we observed that the rate of BIO7662 binding was dependent on the metal ion concentration and that the ED(50) for the metal ion dependence of BIO7662 binding was affected by the concentration of the BIO7662. These studies point to an even more complex interplay between metal ion and ligand binding than previously appreciated and provide evidence for a three-component coupled equilibrium model for metal ion-dependent binding of ligands to alpha(4)beta(1).','Biogen, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142, USA.','The Journal of biological chemistry','J Biol Chem','United States',''),('11488864','','0905-7161','2001','9105713','Early endosseous integration enhanced by dual acid etching of titanium: a torque removal study in the rabbit.','False','Textured implant surfaces are thought to enhance endosseous integration. Torque removal forces have been used as a biomechanical measure of anchorage, or endosseous integration, in which the greater forces required to remove implants may be interpreted as an increase in the strength of bony integration. The purpose of this study was to compare the torque resistance to removal of screw-shaped titanium implants having a dual acid-etched surface (Osseotite) with implants having either a machined surface, or a titanium plasma spray surface that exhibited a significantly more complex surface topography. Three custom screw-shaped implant types - machined, dual acid-etched (DAE), and titanium plasma sprayed (TPS) - were used in this study. Each implant surface was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and optical profilometry. One DAE implant was placed into each distal femur of eighteen adult New Zealand White rabbits along with one of the other implant types. Thus, each rabbit received two DAE implants and one each of the machined, or TPS, implants. All implants measured 3.25 mm in diameter x 4.00 mm in length without holes, grooves or slots to resist rotation. Eighteen rabbits were used for reverse torque measurements. Groups of six rabbits were sacrificed following one, two and three month healing periods. Implants were removed by reverse torque rotation with a digital torque-measuring device. Three implants with the machined surface preparation failed to achieve endosseous integration. All other implants were anchored by bone. Mean torque values for machined, DAE and TPS implants at one, two and three months were 6.00+/-0.64 N-cm, 9.07+/-0.67 N-cm and 6.73+/-0.95 N-cm; 21.86+/-1.37 N-cm, 27.63+/-3.41 N-cm and 27.40+/-3.89 N-cm; and 27.48+/-1.61 N-cm, 44.28+/-4.53 N-cm and 59.23+/-3.88 N-cm, respectively. Clearly, at the earliest time point the stability of DAE implants was comparable to that of TPS implants, while that of the machined implants was an order of magnitude lower. The TPS implants increased resistance to reverse torque removal over the three-month period. The results of this study confirm our previous results that demonstrated enhanced bony anchorage to dual acid-etched implants as compared to machined implants. Furthermore, the present results indicate that dual acid etching of titanium enhances early endosseous integration to a level which is comparable to that achieved by the topographically more complex TPS surfaces.','Division of Associated Specialties, Section of Periodontics, UCLA School of Dentistry, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. pklok@ucla.edu','Clinical oral implants research','Clin Oral Implants Res','Denmark',''),('11488868','','0905-7161','2001','9105713','Histology of human alveolar bone regeneration with a porous tricalcium phosphate.

In one patient, pTCP was used to fill a large alveolar defect in the posterior mandible after the removal of a residual cyst, and in another patient to augment the sinus floor. Biopsies were taken at the time of implant placement, 9.5 and 8 months after grafting, respectively, and processed for hard tissue histology. Goldner-stained histological sections showed considerable replacement of the bone substitute by bone and bone marrow. In the 9.5 months biopsy of the mandible, 34% of the biopsy consisted of mineralised bone tissue and 29% of remaining pTCP, while the biopsy at 8 months after sinus floor augmentation consisted of 20% mineralised bone and 44% remaining pTCP. Bone and osteoid were lying in close contact with the remaining pTCP and were also seen within the micropores of the grafted particles. Tartrate resistant-acid phosphatase (TRAP) multinuclear cells, presumably osteoclasts, were found surrounding, within and in close contact with the pTCP particles, suggesting active resorption of the bone substitute. Remodelling of immature woven bone into mature lamellar bone was also found. No histological signs of inflammation were detected. The limited data presented from these two cases suggest that this graft material, possibly by virtue of its porosity and chemical nature, may be a suitable bone substitute that can biodegrade and be replaced by new mineralising bone tissue.','Department of Oral Cell Biology, ACTA, Vrije Universiteit, Vander Boechorststraat 7, 1081 BT Amsterdam, Netherlands.

Through attachment of 49c to the 5-ASA via azo functionality we obtained UR-12746 (70). Pharmacokinetics experiments with [14C]-70 allow us to reach the following conclusions, critical in the design of these new prodrugs of 5-ASA. Neither the whole molecule 70 nor the carrier 49c were absorbed after oral administration of [14C]-70 in rat as was demonstrated by the absence of plasma levels of radioactivity and the high recovery of it in feces. Effective cleavage of azo bond (84%) by microflora in the colon is achieved. These facts ensure high topical concentrations of 5-ASA and 49c in the colon. Additionally, 70 exhibited a potent anticolitic effect in the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis model in the rat.

Experimental studies established that crater dimensions depend only on the vertical component of the impact velocity. The shock wave generated by the impact weakens with decreasing impact angle. As a result, melting and vaporization depend on impact angle; however, these processes do not seem to depend on the vertical component of the velocity alone. Finally, obliquity influences the fate of the projectile: in particular, the amount and velocity of ricochet are a strong function of impact angle.','Lunar and Planetary Lab., University of Arizona, Tucson, 84721, USA. betty@lpl.arizona.edu','Annual review of earth and planetary sciences','Annu Rev Earth Planet Sci','United States','00026602'),('11600210','','0198-8859','2001','8010936','Editorial.

For the United States, it provided the first opportunity to conduct research in a long-duration space flight environment since the Skylab program in the 1970\'s. Multiple technical as well as cultural challenges were successfully overcome through the dedicated efforts of a relatively small cadre of individuals. The program developed processes to successfully plan, train for and execute research in a long-duration environment, with significant differences identified from short-duration space flight science operations. Between August 1994 and June 1998, thousands of kilograms of research hardware was prepared and launched to Mir, and thousands of kilograms of hardware and data products were returned to Earth. More than 150 Principal Investigators from eight countries were involved in the program in seven major research disciplines: Advanced Technology; Earth Sciences; Fundamental Biology; Human Life Sciences; International Space Station Risk Mitigation; Microgravity; and Space Sciences. Approximately 75 long-duration investigations were completed on Mir, with additional investigations performed on the Shuttle flights that docked with Mir. The flight phase included the participation of seven US astronauts and 20 Russian cosmonauts. The successful completion of the Phase 1 research program not only resulted in high quality science return but also in numerous lessons learned to make the ISS experience more productive.

The present study focused on identifying the major SDS-insoluble PT protein, which we localized to the subacrosomal layer of bovine spermatozoa and cloned by immunoscreening a bull testicular cDNA library. The isolated clones encode a protein of 122 amino acids that bears 67% similarity with histone H2B and contains a predicted histone fold motif. The novel amino terminus of the protein contains a potential bipartite nuclear targeting sequence. Hence, we identified this prominent subacrosomal component as a novel H2B variant, SubH2Bv. Northern blot analyses of SubH2Bv mRNA expression showed that it is testis-specific and is also present in murid testes. Immunocytochemical analysis showed SubH2Bv intimately associates, temporally and spatially, with acrosome formation. While the molecular features of SubH2Bv are common to nuclear proteins, it is never seen developmentally within the nucleus of the spermatid.

Using gel renaturation, pull-down, and solid-phase assays, we confirm that FtsZ and FtsW interact through their C-terminal tails, which carry extensions absent in their Escherichia coli counterparts. Crucial to these interactions is the cluster of aspartate residues Asp(367) to Asp(370) of FtsZ, which most likely interact with a cluster of positively charged residues in the C-terminal tail of FtsW. Mutations of the aspartate residues 367-370 showed that changing three aspartate residues to alanine resulted in complete loss of interaction. This is the first demonstration of the direct interaction between FtsZ and FtsW. We speculate that this interaction between FtsZ and FtsW could serve to anchor FtsZ to the membrane and link septum formation to peptidoglycan synthesis in M. tuberculosis.

Amisyn is mostly cytosolic, but a fraction co-sediments with membranes. The amisyn coil domain can form SNARE complexes of greater thermostability than can VAMP2 with syntaxin 1a and SNAP-25 in vitro, but it lacks a transmembrane anchor and so cannot act as a v-SNARE in this complex. The amisyn coil domain prevents the SNAP-25 C-terminally mediated rescue of botulinum neurotoxin E inhibition of norepinephrine exocytosis in permeabilized PC12 cells to a greater extent than it prevents the regular exocytosis of these vesicles. We propose that amisyn forms nonfusogenic complexes with syntaxin 1a and SNAP-25, holding them in a conformation ready for VAMP2 to replace it to mediate the membrane fusion event, thereby contributing to the regulation of SNARE complex formation.','Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305-5345, USA.','The Journal of biological chemistry','J Biol Chem','United States',''),('12159900','','0362-4331','2002','9877126','Weighing medical ethics for many years to come: a conversation with Harold Shapiro.

On the other hand, Paracelsus adopted the Neoplatonic worldview, was immersed in popular magic, and evolved a system of medicine that self-consciously revolved around magic. These factors seem to place a distinct limit on his role in the demystification of knowledge. However, the magic of Paracelsus entailed a decisive break with the entrenched elitist and esoteric tradition of the occultists and hermeticists.

This phenomenon is due to the generation of a large nonselective ion channel, termed the permeability transition pore (PTP), which contributes to cellular injury during ischemia and reperfusion. Inhibition of PTP generation constitutes a relevant pharmacological target to protect a cell from death. In this study, we examined the effect of S-15176 ((N-[(3,5-di-tertiobutyl-4-hydroxy-1-thiophenyl)]-3-propyl-N\'-(2,3,4-trimethoxybenzyl)piperazine), a novel anti-ischemic agent, on PTP in rat liver mitochondria. S-15176 prevented PTP opening generated by various triggering agents, as attested by the concentration-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial swelling, of mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation and of NADPH oxidation. These effects were associated with an increase in the Ca(2+) loading capacity of mitochondria. S-15176 was a strong inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, but experiments with another trimetazidine derivative devoid of antioxidant activity indicated that this activity was not essential to the inhibitory effect. Binding studies demonstrated that [3H]S-15176 bound to mitochondrial binding sites, especially those localized in the inner membrane. These sites were shared by several well-known inhibitors of PTP opening. These results demonstrate that the mechanism by which S-15176 protects mitochondria against the deleterious effects of ischemia-reperfusion involves inhibition of PTP opening and provide evidence that the drug operates through low structural specificity binding sites located in the inner mitochondrial membrane.','Département de Pharmacologie, Faculté de Médecine de Paris XII, Créteil, France','European journal of pharmacology','Eur J Pharmacol','Netherlands',''),('12742518','','0014-2999','2003','1254354','Behavioral effects of rimcazole analogues alone and in combination with cocaine.','False','Several sigma receptor ligands have been reported to also have affinity for the dopamine transporter, among them rimcazole (9-[3-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)propyl]carbazole dihydrochloride). However, rimcazole lacks behavioral effects like those of other dopamine uptake inhibitors, such as cocaine and GBR 12909 (1-(2-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl)-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine dihydrochloride). Because of this profile, the interactions with cocaine of rimcazole and several of its novel analogues were assessed. The compounds studied were rimcazole, its N-methyl analogue, SH 1-73 (9-[3-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-propyl]carbazole hydrobromide), the dibrominated analogue, SH 1-76 (3,6-dibromo-9-[3-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-propyl]carbazole hydrochloride), and the N-propylphenyl analogues, SH 3-24 ([3-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-4-[3-phenylpropyl]-1-piperazinyl)-propyl]diphenylamine hydrochloride) and SH 3-28 (9-[3-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-4-[3-phenylpropyl]-1-piperazinyl)-propyl]carbazole hydrobromide). The former has a diphenyl-amine group in place of the carbazole moiety of rimcazole, giving the compound additional structural similarity to GBR 12909. The rimcazole analogues produced dose-related decreases in locomotor activity, and also decreased cocaine-stimulated activity in mice. In rats trained to discriminate 10 mg/kg cocaine (i.p.) from saline injections, cocaine and GBR 12909 each produced a dose-related increase in cocaine-appropriate responding. Cocaine also increased rates of responding. SH 3-28 decreased cocaine-appropriate responding at the cocaine training dose to about 58% (SH 3-28) with two of five subjects selecting the cocaine response key. Neither rimcazole nor SH 3-24 produced a significant attenuation of the discriminative effects of cocaine. Rimcazole and its analogs all attenuated the increases in rates of responding produced by cocaine. In contrast to effects obtained with rimcazole analogs, GBR 12909 potentiated the cocaine-induced increases in locomotor activity and operant behavior, as well as the discriminative-stimulus effects of cocaine. The present results indicate that analogues of rimcazole can attenuate the behavioral effects of cocaine, and though the mechanism for these effects is not presently clear, it is possible that this attenuation maybe mediated by actions of the rimcazole analogues at the dopamine transporter and/or sigma receptors.','Department of Health and Human Services, Medications Discovery Research Branch, NIDA Intramural Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA. jkatz@intra.nida.nih.gov','European journal of pharmacology','Eur J Pharmacol','Netherlands',''),('12742519','','0014-2999','2003','1254354','Risperidone reduces limited access alcohol drinking in alcohol-preferring rats.','False','An atypical antipsychotic drug risperidone reduced ethanol drinking of ethanol-preferring Alko, Alcohol (AA) rats in a limited access paradigm.

Compressed alphabets were seen to improve performance in local similarity discovery, but no evidence was found of improvements when applied to distance estimates. The performance of our local similarity discovery method was compared with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) used in MAFFT, which has O(L log L) time complexity. The method for achieving comparable coverage to FFT is revealed here, and is more than an order of magnitude faster. We suggest using k-mer distance for fast, approximate phylogenetic tree construction, and show that a speed improvement of more than three orders of magnitude can be achieved relative to standard distance methods, which require alignments.','bob@drive5.com','Nucleic acids research','Nucleic Acids Res','England',''),('14744982','PMC373309','0305-1048','2004','0411011','Superior 5\' homogeneity of RNA from ATP-initiated transcription under the T7 phi 2.5 promoter.','False','Transcription from the commonly used GTP- initiating T7 class III promoter phi6.5 frequently produces heterogeneous RNA at both 3\' and 5\' ends.

The cats were divided into two groups, sevoflurane group and halothane group, of eight subjects each. As parameters of the hypoxic ventilatory response, A value [the slope of the hyperbolic curve, V(E) = V(0) + A/(Pa(O)(2)-32)] and ratio of V(50) (the minute volume obtained from the hyperbolic equation when Pa(O)(2) = 50 mmHg) to V(0) were studied. These two parameters were examined at three states, sedative state with ketamine as the control, ketamine plus 0.1 MAC inhalation anesthetic, and ketamine plus 0.5 MAC inhalation anesthetic. In the sevoflurane group, the A values were 4789 +/- 1518, 2187 +/- 1214, 1730 +/- 880 (mean +/- SE. ml.min(-1).mmHg) at the control state, 0.1 MAC and 0.5 MAC, respectively.

In the present study, we demonstrate that the actin-regulating protein, Eps8, is recruited to the spine head during chemically induced long-term potentiation in culture and that inhibition of its actin-capping activity impairs spine enlargement and plasticity. Accordingly, mice lacking Eps8 display immature spines, which are unable to undergo potentiation, and are impaired in cognitive functions. Additionally, we found that reduction in the levels of Eps8 occurs in brains of patients affected by autism compared to controls.

The determination of blood flow changes in individual vessels is an important aspect of understanding these hemodynamic signals. Blood flow can be calculated from the measurements of vessel diameter and blood velocity. When using line-scan imaging, the movement of blood in the vessel leads to streaks in space-time images, where streak angle is a function of the blood velocity. A variety of methods have been proposed to determine blood velocity from such space-time image sequences. Of these, the Radon transform is relatively easy to implement and has fast data processing. However, the precision of the velocity measurements is dependent on the number of Radon transforms performed, which creates a trade-off between the processing speed and measurement precision. In addition, factors like image contrast, imaging depth, image acquisition speed, and movement artifacts especially in large mammals, can potentially lead to data acquisition that results in erroneous velocity measurements. Here we show that pre-processing the data with a Sobel filter and iterative application of Radon transforms address these issues and provide more accurate blood velocity measurements. Improved signal quality of the image as a result of Sobel filtering increases the accuracy and the iterative Radon transform offers both increased precision and an order of magnitude faster implementation of velocity measurements. This algorithm does not use a priori knowledge of angle information and therefore is sensitive to sudden changes in blood flow.

Yeast S. cerevisiae, in particular, has proven to be an ideal chassis for synthetic genome assemblies by exploiting its efficient homologous recombination. However, this property of efficient homologous recombination poses a problem for multigene assemblies in yeast, since repeated usage of standard parts, such as transcriptional terminators, can lead to rearrangements of the repeats in assembled DNA constructs in vivo. To address this issue in developing a library of orthogonal genetic components for yeast, we designed a set of short synthetic terminators based on a consensus sequence with random linkers to avoid repetitive sequences. We constructed a series of expression vectors with these synthetic terminators for efficient assembly of synthetic genes using Gateway recombination reactions. We also constructed two BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) vectors for assembling multiple transcription units with the synthetic terminators in vitro and their integration in the yeast genome. The tandem array of synthetic genes integrated in the genome by this method is highly stable because there are few homologous segments in the synthetic constructs. Using this system of assembly and genomic integration of transcription units, we tested the synthetic terminators and their influence on the proximal transcription units. Although all the synthetic terminators have the common consensus with the identical length, they showed different activities and impacts on the neighboring transcription units.','Institute of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition, University of Aberdeen , Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, U.K.\nInstitute of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition, University of Aberdeen , Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, U.K.','ACS synthetic biology','ACS Synth Biol','United States',''),('27687974','','1941-0611','2016','101536246','SAR11 Bacteria: The Most Abundant Plankton in the Oceans.','False','SAR11 is a group of small, carbon-oxidizing cells that reach a global estimated population size of 2.4 × 1028 cells-approximately 25% of all plankton. They are found throughout the oceans but reach their largest numbers in stratified, oligotrophic gyres, which are an expanding habitat in the warming oceans. SAR11 likely had a Precambrian origin and, over geological time, evolved into the niche of harvesting labile, low-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter (DOM). SAR11 cells are minimal in size and complexity, a phenomenon known as streamlining that is thought to benefit them by lowering the material costs of replication and maximizing transport functions that are essential to competition at ultralow nutrient concentrations. One of the surprises in SAR11 metabolism is their ability to both oxidize and produce a variety of volatile organic compounds that can diffuse into the atmosphere. SAR11 cells divide slowly and lack many forms of regulation commonly used by bacterial cells to adjust to changing environmental conditions. As a result of genome reduction, they require an unusual range of nutrients, which leads to complex biochemical interactions with other plankton. The study of SAR11 is providing insight into the biogeochemistry of labile DOM and is affecting microbiology beyond marine science by providing a model for understanding the evolution and function of streamlined cells.

B. subtilis ferrochelatase produced in Escherichia coli was purified. It was found to be a monomeric, water-soluble enzyme of molecular mass 35 kDa which in addition to Fe2+ can incorporate Zn2+ and Cu2+ into protoporphyrin IX. Chemical modification experiments indicated that the single cysteine residue in the ferrochelatase is required for enzyme activity although it is not a conserved residue compared to other ferrochelatases. In growing B. subtilis, the ferrochelatase constitutes approximately 0.05% (by mass) of the total cell protein, which corresponds to some 600 ferrochelatase molecules/cell. The turnover number of isolated ferrochelatase, 18-29 min-1, was found to be consistent with the rate of haem synthesis in exponentially growing cells (0.2 mol haem formed/min/mol enzyme). It is concluded that the B. subtilis ferrochelatase has enzymic properties which are similar to those of other characterised ferrochelatases of known primary structure, i.e. ferrochelatases of the mitochondrial inner membrane of yeast and mammalian cells.

ATP, 2-methylthio-ATP, and ADP stimulated [3H]thymidine and [3H]leucine incorporation and cell growth. AMP, adenosine, UTP, and P2x agonists showed little of these effects. Reactive blue 2, a P2Y purinoceptor antagonist, was effective in suppressing the mitogenic effect of ATP and 2-methylthio-ATP, indicating that extracellular ATP-induced VSMC proliferation is mediated by P2Y purinoceptors. The P2Y purinoceptor activation was coupled to a pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive G protein (Gq) and triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis with subsequent activation of protein kinase C (PKC), Raf-1, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in VSMCs. In response to ATP, both 42-and 44-kDa MAPKs were activated, and tyrosine was phosphorylated. Western blot analysis using PKC isozyme-specific antibodies indicated that VSMCs express PKC-alpha, PKC-delta, and PKC-zeta. A complete down-regulation of PKC-alpha and PKC-delta was seen after 24-hr treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. When cells were pretreated with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate for 24 hr and subsequently challenged with ATP, Raf-1 activation and 42-kDa as well as 44-kDa MAPK tyrosine phosphorylation failed to be induced. These results demonstrate that ATP-induced Raf-1 and MAPK activations involve the activation of PKC-alpha and PKC-delta. P2Y purinoceptor stimulation with ATP also caused accumulation of c-fos and c-myc mRNAs. Both Reactive blue 2 and staurosporine significantly blocked this increase by ATP. In conclusion, the mitogenic effect of ATP seemed to be triggered by activation of the Gq protein-coupled P2Y purinoceptor that led to the formation of inositol trisphosphate and activation of PKC. PKC and, in turn, Raf-1 and MAPK were then activated, leading eventually to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation.','Department of Pharmacology, Chang Gung College of Medicine and Technology, Kwei-San, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan. smyu@cguaplo.cgu.edu','Molecular pharmacology','Mol Pharmacol','United States',''),('8941094','','0009-7322','1996','0147763','Assessment of myocardial viability in patients with chronic coronary artery disease.

Confirming our earlier work, intestinal IgVH genes were highly mutated in plasma cells from older individuals (> 30 years). IgVH genes were significantly less mutated in samples taken from patients aged 11-30 years, and there were fewer mutations again in samples from young children (< 11 years). In age-matched specimens the number of mutations was equivalent in the duodenum and colon. Using complementarity-determining region 3 primers to amplify specific Ig gene rearrangements, evidence was also found for the existence of related lamina propria plasma cells along the small bowel and colon, although these were quite scarce. In addition, analysis of the numbers of related clones in a random sampling from discrete areas of lamina propria indicates that the local population is diverse. These results suggest that the highly mutated IgVH genes in adult intestinal plasma cells are a consequence of chronic antigen exposure with age. Duodenal plasma cells are as highly mutated as colonic plasma cells, despite the fact that the upper bowel has no indigenous microbial flora (the stimulus for intestinal plasma cells).
